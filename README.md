# (wip) darlene-sg3

Code for running inference and interpolation on a stylegan3 trained on synthetic data.

You can explore the dataset semantically with this colab. [![OpenAI DALL-E Generations](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://gist.github.com/afiaka87/f662486fc45199fa4394f3456c8246d7#file-dalle_blog_semantic_search-ipynb)

This code is licensed under MIT unless (and, I am not a lawyer) breaking the terms outlined in the nvidia stylegan3 repository; which essentially automatically gives them ownership over anything trained with it as far as I can tell and prevents commercial use (unless it's for them, of course).

I would eventually also like to compare the performance on this dataset with the clean room implementation of alias free gan "rosinality" which as far as I can tell is not at all restricted by the terms laid out in stylegan3 as it was implemented before the code was released.
